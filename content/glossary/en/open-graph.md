## Definition

**Open Graph (OG)** is a set of meta tags originally created by Facebook for link previews in social feeds. Tags live in the HTML `<head>` (e.g. `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:type`) and describe what the page is about. They are read by AI crawlers, chat apps, messaging platforms, and link-unfurling services.

Open Graph does not replace Schema.org or JSON-LD; it complements them by providing a compact, widely supported summary that agents and platforms use to understand and display your pages.

## Relevance to GEO

Setting Open Graph tags on all key pages helps agents and AI search experiences show accurate titles, descriptions, and images when referencing your content.
