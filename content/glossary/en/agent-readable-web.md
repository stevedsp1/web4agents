## Definition

The **agent-readable web** is the subset of the web that is structured and documented so that AI agents can reliably read, interpret, and act on it. It builds on machine-readable content, clear semantics, and actionable interfaces.

## Relation to GEO

GEO is the practice set that moves a site toward the agent-readable web: structured data, llms.txt, clear DOM semantics, and safe exposure of actions and data.
