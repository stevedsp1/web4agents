## Definition

**Actionable DOM** refers to the practice of structuring HTML so that autonomous agents can discover and execute actions: submitting forms, following links to next steps, or triggering APIs. Semantic elements, ARIA labels, and clear affordances make the DOM actionable.

## Key principles

- Use semantic form elements and associate labels.
- Provide clear next-step links (e.g. "Add to cart", "Request audit").
- Expose APIs or structured endpoints when appropriate.
