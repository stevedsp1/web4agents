## Definition

**Semantic density** is the ratio of meaningful, factual information to the total number of tokens in a text. High semantic density means less filler and more signal per token. RAG systems prefer dense content because retrieved chunks are limited by context size; dense sections yield more useful information per chunk and improve answer quality.

## Relevance to GEO

Writing with clear facts, minimal fluff, and self-contained sections increases semantic density. Combined with heading-based chunking and JSON-LD, it makes your content more likely to be retrieved and cited accurately by RAG-based agents.
