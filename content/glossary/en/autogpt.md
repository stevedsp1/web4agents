## Overview

AutoGPT is an autonomous AI agent that can browse the web, use tools, and chain steps to accomplish goals. It exemplifies the kind of agent that benefits from an agent-readable web.

## Relevance to GEO

Agents like AutoGPT consume web content to make decisions. Sites optimized with GEO (clear structure, actionable DOM, structured data) are easier for such agents to interpret and use correctly.
