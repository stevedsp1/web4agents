## Definition

A **semantic fragment** is a self-contained unit of web content that carries a clear, machine-interpretable meaning. It can be a block of structured data (e.g. Schema.org), a well-marked-up section, or a concise text block that agents can extract and use without full-page context.

## Why it matters for GEO

Agents often need to combine information from multiple sources. Semantic fragments reduce ambiguity and improve reliability when agents quote, compare, or act on your content.
