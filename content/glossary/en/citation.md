## Definition

A **citation** in the AI context is when an AI system (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, etc.) uses your content to answer a question and attributes it — by naming your site, including a link, or both. It is the GEO analogue of ranking in traditional search: your content is surfaced in the answer. Citations can be explicit (named source, clickable link) or implicit (content shapes the answer without attribution). Monitoring citations measures your GEO effectiveness.

## Relevance to GEO

The goal of GEO is to increase the likelihood and quality of citations. Strong structured data, E-E-A-T signals, backlinks, and agent-friendly content improve the chance your site is cited when users ask relevant questions.
