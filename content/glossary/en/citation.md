## Definition

A **citation** in the AI context is when an AI system (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews, etc.) uses your content to answer a question and attributes it — by naming your site, including a link, or both. It is the GEO analogue of ranking in traditional search: your content is surfaced in the answer. Citations can be explicit (named source, clickable link) or implicit (content shapes the answer without attribution). Monitoring citations measures your GEO effectiveness.

## Grounding vs displayed citations

In generative search systems (AI Overviews, AI Mode, ChatGPT Search), the model first relies on a set of **grounding URLs** (sources retrieved upstream). Only a subset of these is then **displayed** to the user as clickable links. Studies that do not separate “URLs used for grounding” from “URLs actually shown” can over- or underestimate a domain’s visibility. In practice, one can distinguish: sidebar-visible sources, in-text citations (links in the response body), and hidden grounding URLs (consulted by the model but not shown). For a technical analysis of Google AI Overviews and AI Mode, see [AIO/AIM Deep-dive (RESONEO)](https://think.resoneo.com/aio-aim-deepdive/).

## Relevance to GEO

The goal of GEO is to increase the likelihood and quality of citations. Strong structured data, E-E-A-T signals, backlinks, and agent-friendly content improve the chance your site is cited when users ask relevant questions.
