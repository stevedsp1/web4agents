## Definition

A **backlink** (or inbound link) is a hyperlink from another website to your site. Backlinks are one of the oldest ranking signals in SEO: a link from a trusted, relevant site signals that your content is credible. Quality factors include domain authority of the linking site, topical relevance, anchor text, and placement (editorial vs. footer/sidebar).

In GEO, backlinks act as a proxy for **domain authority**, which AI systems use when deciding which sources to cite in answers.

## Relevance to GEO

Sites with strong backlink profiles are more likely to appear in AI-generated answers. Building quality backlinks supports both traditional SEO and GEO visibility; combine with internal linking to distribute authority across your site.
