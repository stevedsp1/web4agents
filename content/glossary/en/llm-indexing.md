## Definition

**LLM indexing** is the process through which web content is crawled, processed, and stored for use by LLMs and AI agents. It includes traditional search indexing as well as agent-specific mechanisms (e.g. llms.txt, structured data) that influence how your site is represented in agent knowledge.

## Relevance to GEO

Ensuring your content is indexable in a clear, structured way improves how agents retrieve and cite your pages. GEO practices directly support better LLM indexing outcomes.
