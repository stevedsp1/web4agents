## Definition

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the practice of optimizing web content and technical setup so that search engines (e.g. Google, Bing) crawl, understand, and rank pages in organic search results. It targets crawlers like Googlebot, focuses on keyword relevance and link authority, and aims for clicks to the site (blue links).

GEO extends SEO: both rely on quality content, technical health, structured data, and crawlability. A solid SEO foundation is largely compatible with GEO; GEO adds agent-specific signals (llms.txt, Content Signals, retrieval-friendly structure).

## Relevance to GEO

SEO and GEO share robots.txt, sitemap.xml, Schema.org, and canonical/hreflang. GEO adds practices for AI agents and generative search while keeping core SEO intact.
