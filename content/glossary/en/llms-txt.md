## Definition

**llms.txt** is a standard (in the spirit of robots.txt) that defines a text file at `/.well-known/llms.txt` or `/llms.txt` to describe a site for LLMs and agents: owner, rules, and pointers to key content.

## Relevance to GEO

Providing an llms.txt file is a core GEO practice. It helps agents discover your site’s purpose, boundaries, and main resources without scraping the entire site.
