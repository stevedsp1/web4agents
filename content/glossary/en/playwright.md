## Overview

Playwright is an open-source browser automation library that enables scripting of Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It is used for testing, scraping, and by AI agents that need to render and interact with pages like a real browser.

## Relevance to GEO

When agents use Playwright to load your site, a well-structured DOM and clear semantics improve reliability. GEO practices (semantic HTML, accessible forms, structured data) make automated interaction more predictable.
