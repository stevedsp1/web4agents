## Overview

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides abstractions for chains, agents, tools, and retrieval, including web browsing and document parsing.

## Relevance to GEO

Agents built with LangChain often consume web content. Sites that follow GEO practices (structured data, clear semantics, llms.txt) are easier for LangChain-based agents to parse and use reliably.
