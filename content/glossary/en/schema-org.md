## Definition

**schema.org** is a collaborative vocabulary used to mark up content in structured formats (JSON-LD, microdata, RDFa). It defines types such as Article, Product, Organization, and Offer so that search engines and agents can understand page content.

## Relevance to GEO

Structured data using schema.org is a cornerstone of GEO. It enables agents to reliably extract facts (prices, dates, authors) and improves visibility in both traditional search and generative answers.
