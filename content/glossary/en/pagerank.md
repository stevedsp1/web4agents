## Definition

**PageRank** is the link-based ranking signal at the core of Google's algorithm: pages that receive links from other important pages are considered more important. A single high-quality backlink from an authoritative domain can significantly affect rankings. Links pass PageRank by default; `rel="nofollow"` or `rel="sponsored"` instructs Google not to pass it. Internal links distribute PageRank within your site.

## Relevance to GEO

Domain and page authority (influenced by PageRank and backlinks) correlate with how often AI systems cite a source. Building quality backlinks and a strong internal linking structure supports both traditional SEO and GEO visibility.
