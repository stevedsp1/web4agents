## Definition

**Machine-readable content** is information presented in a format that programs and AI agents can parse unambiguously: JSON-LD, microdata, well-defined APIs, or clear textual structure that tools can extract reliably.

## Why it matters

Agents depend on machine-readable signals to quote prices, dates, and facts. Combining structured data (e.g. Schema.org) with clear text improves both traditional SEO and GEO.
