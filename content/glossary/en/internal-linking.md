## Definition

**Internal linking** is the practice of linking from one page on your site to another. For SEO, internal links distribute PageRank and help crawlers discover content. For AI agents, they define the **navigation graph**: which pages are important, how topics relate, and where to go for more detail. Key concepts include **link depth** (clicks from homepage — keep important pages within ~3 clicks) and **anchor text** (descriptive text that signals what the linked page is about).

## Relevance to GEO

Strong internal linking helps agents discover and prioritize pages, follow topic chains, and treat well-linked pages as more authoritative. Avoid orphan pages (no inbound internal links); ensure every important page is reachable from a main entry point.
