The web is evolving. Beyond human visitors and traditional search engines, a new wave of **autonomous AI agents** now browses, reads, and acts on web content. These agents — powered by large language models — can fill forms, compare products, summarize pages, and cite your content in their answers.

## What is the agent-ready web?

An **agent-ready website** is one that is optimized not only for human users and search crawlers, but also for AI agents. It is:

- **Readable** — Structured data (Schema.org, JSON-LD), clean HTML semantics, and machine-parseable content allow agents to extract facts accurately.
- **Actionable** — Clear CTAs, well-formed forms, and public APIs let agents complete tasks, not just read.
- **Bounded** — Files like `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` set clear boundaries: what agents may access, what they should ignore, and how they should use your content.

## Why does it matter?

AI-powered search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) increasingly replaces traditional search for many queries. If your content is not agent-friendly:

- Agents may **misinterpret** your pages or skip them entirely.
- You lose **citation opportunities** in AI-generated answers.
- Your competitors who optimize for agents will be **more visible**.

## What this documentation covers

This documentation provides practical, actionable guides to make your website agent-ready:

- **Crawlers & Indexing** — How AI crawlers work, how to control access with robots.txt, and how LLMs index your content.
- **Technical SEO** — Canonical URLs, internal linking, content freshness, backlinks, and E-E-A-T trust signals.
- **Structured Data** — Schema.org, JSON-LD, Open Graph, and sitemap.xml for machine-readable content.

- **Content & Markup** — Writing for agents, RAG optimization, semantic HTML, accessible forms, and actionable DOM.
- **Agent Protocols** — MCP and OpenAPI to expose your services to AI agents programmatically.
